# Process

## Changing Ownership

As of Jan 2023, If you purchase a Rivian from a third-party you must email Rivian a copy of the
bill of sale and a copy of your drivers license. The process takes 7-10 days.. so do it ASAP after
purchase.

## Removal of linked Charge Point Account

Removing a linked Charge Point account can be done by your local Service Center.
Today it isn't generally possible by end users.

## Service Technician

Currently, costs for a mobile Rivian Service Technician to show up for a non-warranty covered
trip are a steep $700+.  Talk to customer service and make sure your work is covered by warranty.
