# General Maintenance

## Tire Rotation

> TIP: If you have a full size spare, be sure to rotate your spare into the mix before 8k miles!
> This will give you 25% more tire life. After around 10k miles of wear, the tread difference
> generally gets too great to perform a 5-tire rotation.

Be sure to set the highest off-road ride-height, and enable tire change mode in the service menu!
It's recommended to have at least two jack methods to enable you access to two tires at a time.

### Conserve Mode

Conserve mode will consume your front tires at a faster rate than your rear. (conserve is front
wheel drive). Be extra sure to practice good tire rotation when using conserve mode!

### Lug Nut Torque

Lug nuts should be torqued to 190 Nm / 140 Ft Lb in a standard star pattern

### TPMS Sensors

The Rivian vehicles auto-learn the TPMS sensor positions after a tire rotation. Rivian support
has confirmed this only takes 10-15 minutes of driving. No tool needed.

## Powered Tonneau cover

Lubricating the Tonneau cover will help ensure it continues to function long into the future.
These steps apply to the original Tonneau cover, as well as the redesigned model.
