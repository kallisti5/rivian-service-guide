# General Maintenance

## Tire Rotation

> TIP: If you have a full size spare, be sure to rotate your spare into the mix before 8k miles!
> This will give you 25% more tire life. After around 10k miles of wear, the tread difference
> generally gets too great to perform a 5-tire rotation.

Be sure to set the highest off-road ride-height, and enable tire change mode in the service menu!
It's recommended to have at least two jack methods to enable you access to two tires at a time.

### Conserve Mode

Conserve mode will consume your front tires at a faster rate than your rear. (conserve is front
wheel drive). Be extra sure to practice good tire rotation when using conserve mode!

### Lug Nut Torque

Lug nuts should be torqued to 190 Nm / 140 Ft Lb in a standard star pattern

### TPMS Sensors

The Rivian vehicles auto-learn the TPMS sensor positions after a tire rotation. Rivian support
has confirmed this only takes 10-15 minutes of driving. No tool needed.

## Powered Tonneau cover

Lubricating the Tonneau cover will help ensure it continues to function long into the future.
These steps apply to the original Tonneau cover, as well as the redesigned model.

### Supplies

  * [WD-40 Specialist Dry Lube](https://amzn.to/4hwS9Gx)
  * Microfiber cloth or paper towel

### Process

* Clean off any grime or debris with Tonneau closed.
* Spray dry-lube in-between each panel section with the straw nozzle.
* Open the Tonneau.
* Spray the tracks on either side using the straw nozzle.
* Spray around the front edge of the Tonneau track on either side.
* Wipe off excess. Close the Tonneau.
* Repeat every month or two to buy yourself time.

If your Tonneau jams, contact Rivian service. They'll open it fully and lock it out until
the final solution is released.
